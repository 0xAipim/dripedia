# Roadmap
An overview of our achievements and of what's next.

---

### 2021
**Official Launch:**
On the 22nd of April, DRIP presale tokens were distributed, and the website and contracts were officially released.

**BeeFarm Partnership:**
[ BeeFarm](https://app.beefarm.finance) was a yield farming protocol on BNB Chain. This partnership created staking opportunities on BeeFarm for the following LP pairs: DRIP-BEE, DRIP-BUSD, DRIP-BNB. The staking reward was BEE, the native token of the farm.
Before this partnership, the only liquidity for DRIP was on its native DEX. [According to Forex Shark](https://web.archive.org/web/20210629160630/https://forexshark.medium.com/history-in-the-making-2fbb4b3c44d1), this partnership seeked to add liquidity on Pancake Swap, allowing the project to have decentralized liquidity and appear on analytic sites.
The pools were launched on the 13th of July, adding around $400K worth of liquidity to Pancake Swap DRIP pools on the first day.

**DRIP Liberation:**
The [DRIP Liberation](https://theanimal.farm/dripliberation) contract allows players to acquire DRIP-BUSD LP tokens without paying the DRIP transaction tax. This contract acts as a DEX aggregator by buying DRIP on whichever DEX is providing the best price, after accounting for swap fees and price impact.

**DRIP Garden:**
The [DRIP Garden](https://theanimal.farm/garden) is a "miner game", where players exchange their DRIP-BUSD LP tokens for plants at a varying rate. Plants generate seeds at a constant rate. Seeds can be planted (compounding deposits) or harvested: exchanged for DRIP-BUSD LP tokens at a varying rate (depends on the contract's balance). The variable exchange rates are set in a way to always make it attractive for new capital to join the project.
One week before the launch of DRIP Liberation & DRIP Garden on the 16 of December, there was $1.52M worth of DRIP-BUSD liquidity on Pancake Swap. By the end of the month, the total liquidity was worth $14.17M.

### 2022

**The Manor Farm Partnership:**
[ The Manor Farm](https://themanor.farm) was a layer 1 yield farming/lending protocol on BNB Chain. This partnership created staking opportunities for DRIP-BUSD tokens on The Manor Farm, yielding REV tokens (later exchangeable for Animal Farm tokens). Staking DRIP-BUSD tokens had a 1% fee, that went to funding the DRIP Faucet tax pool. The Manor Farm launched on the 4th of January, and ended its emissions on the 18th of January.

**The Animal Farm Partnership:**
[ The Animal Farm](https://theanimal.farm) is a layer 2 yield farming/lending protocol on BNB Chain, and the successor of The Manor Farm. This partnership created the same staking opportunity as in The Manor Farm, except that the yield is in PIGS tokens (the project's governance token). The Animal Farm launched on the 3rd of February.

### What's next?
**Team competitions and website updates:**
Create weekly/monthly competitions for teams to compete for prizes on member growth or other metrics. Along with this feature, there will be a visual and functional update to the website.

**Casino Partnership:**
This partnership will add usage for the DRIP token in the partner casino. Details to be announced.

**Trap and Hip Hop Artists NFTs:**
Development of NFTs that are backed by DRIP. Details to be announced.

**Cross chain NFT protocol partnership:**
Development a cross chain (BNB Chain and ETH Blockchain) NFT protocol, that would have utility on the DRIP Network and on the partner's platform.

**Access control API:**
Development of APIs that allow Faucet team leaders to authenticate access according to team membership status, deposit amount, and other metrics. This would allow, for example, content creators to offer access to their exclusive content in return for people joining their DRIP Faucet team.
