# Introduction

### What is the DRIP Network?

The DRIP Network is a deflationary daily yield project on the BNB Chain. It is comprised by the Faucet, Reservoir, and Fountain.

By locking DRIP tokens into the **Faucet**, players yield 1% daily returns (limited to 365% of total deposits and to 100K DRIP tokens). The paid out yield comes from the transaction taxes on the DRIP token. Generated yield can be withdrawn or recompounded for exponential daily yields.

Players interested in yield farming can use the **Reservoir**, by depositing BNB which is transformed into a DRIP-BNB LP token (DROP), which earns rewards from swap fees on DRIP’s native DEX (decentralized exchange) and from Reservoir deposit and withdraw fees.

On the **Fountain** page, players can exchange between DRIP and BNB, using our native DEX. The DRIP transaction tax for buying DRIP using Fountain is waived. Additionally, there are DRIP-BUSD and DRIP-WBNB pools available on Pancake Swap.

### What is the $DRIP token?

DRIP is the native token of our project. There’s a 10% tax charged on DRIP transactions (with some exceptions), which goes to the Faucet tax pool. The initial supply is 1 million DRIP tokens. In a situation where there’s not enough DRIP tokens in the tax pool to pay out Faucet rewards, new tokens will be minted to guarantee the rewards.

### Usages
Beyond being an investment opportunity for individuals, the DRIP Network's products can be used in a variety of interesting ways.

**Audience monetization:**
Content creators/influencers can receive a stream of referral rewards by asking their audience to join their team in the DRIP Faucet. This dynamic also benefits the audience, who will receive the 1% daily yield on their deposits. Content creators can also send airdrops to their team, in order to give back and attract new team members.

**Content monetization:**
Referral rewards from the DRIP Faucet can be a great way to monetize content such as access to courses, private groups, and others. Tools to make this process seamless are under development.

**Reserve currency:**
By using DRIP as a reserve currency, other platforms can take advantage of our resilient and sustainable daily yields. An example of this could be NFTs backed by DRIP Faucet deposits, generating yield to its current owner and to its creator.
