# Reservoir
Earn passive BNB rewards by adding liquidity to the DRIP token.

---
### How does it work?
The Reservoir allows players to earn yield farming rewards by adding DRIP-BNB liquidity to the project's native DEX (decentralized exchange). This provides price volatility protection and a rising price floor, as permanently locked liquidity is generated during this process.

To enter and exit the Reservoir, players must exchange BNB â†” DROP (a DRIP-BNB LP token). A 10% tax is charged on this transaction, that is used for: (2%) buying DROP and distributing it to the players in the Reservoir; (5%) supplying the Reservoir dividend pool, which pays out 2% daily of its balance to players in the Reservoir; (3%) becoming locked liquidity.

There is a 1% swap fee between DRIP and BNB on the native DEX, which goes to the Reservoir dividend pool. This creates a source of rewards for Reservoir players that is not depended on people joining/leaving the Reservoir.

Players in the Reservoir receive the following rewards (proportional to their share of DROP holdings):
- 2% a day of the balance of the Reservoir dividend pool (BNB rewards)
- 2% of the BNB to DROP swaps (DROP rewards)
