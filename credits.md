### DRIPedia Translation Guide

This guide explains the steps for translating the DRIPedia contents into another language.

**Step 1:**
Download the source files for the DRIPedia project at https://github.com/0xAipim/dripedia (Code -> Download ZIP)

**Step 2:**
Extract the downloaded zip file.

**Step 3:**
The files are in the .md format (markdown), so you'll need a program to edit them. Personally I like Obsidian (https://obsidian.md/) and Atom (https://atom.io/).

**Step 4:**
Open the extracted zip file in the editor you chose. Make a copy of an existing language folder (example the "en" folder), and rename it to the code for your language (http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).

**Step 5:**
Translate the files in the new folder you've created

**Step 6:**
When you're finished, zip the files and send them to @o_aipim on telegram.

**Bonus step:**
If you want to checkout how things will look like on the live website, you can download retype (the website generator tool used for the project) at https://retype.com. On their website there are instructions on how to use this tool.
