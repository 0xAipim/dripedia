## What are the risks involved in participating into the DRIP Network?
**Economic risks:**
Just like any financial asset, the price of the DRIP token is subject to volatility.
There's the possibility of new DRIP being minted to pay out Faucet rewards if the tax pool doesn't have enough funds to do so, which would cause inflation.

**How these economic risks are mitigated:**
The game theory behind the project seeks to align the players' incentives towards actions that promote platform sustainability. This is done through a 10% tax on all transactions, with positive actions (such as buying DRIP and compounding Faucet rewards) receiving tax discounts or exemptions.
When DRIP is deposited into the Faucet it is removed from circulation. This reduces the available supply for at least 100 days. For players that compound their gains, the available supply is reduced for an even longer period of time. Whale taxes and the 100K DRIP max withdraw amount prevent big players from draining the project, making them reinvest to continue receiving yield. Reservoir deposits and withdraws create an ever growing permanently locked liquidity, leading to an ever growing price floor.

**Cyber-security risks:**
Smart contracts are at risk of having exploits that lead to loss of funds.
DRIP Network's smart contracts have been audited by Slither, a Solidity static analysis framework.

## Is the DRIP Network a Pyramid Scheme?
Pyramid schemes are systems where players in the higher levels get a larger commission, as the majority of the profits are funneled to a few at the top. This is usually hidden behind the sale of products or services that produce almost no profit in themselves.

The DRIP Network operates fully on chain. Its smart contracts are open-source, and all transactions with them are publicly available. The sources of the funds and the status of the project can be viewed by anyone, at anytime (using tools like BscScan).

Players using the Faucet don't have to engage in team building if they don't want to, and will still continue to receive their Faucet rewards.
Referral rewards are a bonus that fairly compensates players for helping expand the project and attract new players and capital. This reward is given during deposits, only goes to one player at a time, and has several eligibility requirements.
There's a max payout of 100k DRIP, meaning senior players will eventually have to create a new wallet to continue receiving Faucet rewards, and onboard other new players to continue receiving referral rewards. This means there's a limited advantage to getting in early.

All of this means players who enter the system later can make just as much or more than the initial wallets who entered the project, and there is no benefit to getting in early as far as how the team building structure goes. This is the opposite of a pyramid scheme. We are just a DeFi project that benefits people for onboarding capital in a fair and ingenious way.

## Was DRIP inspired in any projects?
DRIP took inspiration from the BankRoll Flow, a project on TRON.
